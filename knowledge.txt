LangChain is a powerful Python framework that helps you build applications using language models.
It supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to allow LLMs to use your own custom data.
You can connect LangChain to OpenAI, HuggingFace, ChromaDB, and more.
LangChain chains are composable, letting you combine prompt templates, retrievers, and LLMs.
